## Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is a project that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It leverages machine learning techniques and popular Python libraries like Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas to deliver personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked in the past.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines multiple recommendation techniques for improved accuracy.
